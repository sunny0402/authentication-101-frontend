## My Notes

Backed end /register route is expecting user and pwd properties.
So if named them something else in frontend, need to specify.

```
const handleSubmit = async (e)=>{
    ...
await axios.post('register',
JSON.stringify(user :username, pwd: myVarName),
...
)}
```

Upond successful registration backend will respond with an access token.

```
console.log(response.data)
console.log(response.accessToken)
console.log(JSON.stringify(response))

```
